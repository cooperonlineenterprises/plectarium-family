# Generated Integrity

Files in this directory are derived, non-authoritative, and point-in-time.
They never grant permission or prove project readiness.

`refresh.py` validates managed sources before atomically writing
`manifest.json` and `validation-report.json`. The final read-only check verifies
their shared source fingerprint. Managed-source changes make them stale.
An interrupted refresh leaves a `*.tmp` file that the read-only check rejects;
inspect it, remove it only after confirming no authoritative source is lost,
then rerun refresh and check.

Checksums or fingerprints prove byte consistency within their declared scope,
not correctness, security, freshness, provenance, approval, or legal rights.
