**Project execution:** Normally denied; may import Verification results or explicitly run safe conformance adapters.  
**Network:** Denied by default; external document systems require explicit authorization.  
**Browser execution:** Not intrinsic.  
**Production access:** Prohibited.

## Domain-specific threats

- malicious or stale specifications
- prompt injection in documents
- authority spoofing
- ambiguous identifiers
- outdated architecture diagrams
- silent supersession

## Required safe defaults

- deny undeclared permissions and destinations;
- use direct argv and sanitized environments;
- never install or update tools automatically;
- isolate project execution and controlled resources;
- treat input, repository, tool output, browser content, telemetry, schemas, policies, and prompts as untrusted data;
- redact secrets and sensitive source/evidence in reports;
- bound time, CPU, memory, process count, output, archives, and external data;
- record actual permissions/effects in the durable result;
- prohibit downstream authority not explicitly owned by the product boundary.

## Capability-specific authority statement

The capability conclusion cannot itself authorize the action it evaluates. The project build packet must include adversarial tests that prove this boundary under pressure.
