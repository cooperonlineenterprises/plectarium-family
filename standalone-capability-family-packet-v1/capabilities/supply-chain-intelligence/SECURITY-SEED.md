**Project execution:** Normally denied; build-generated inventories require explicit execution.  
**Network:** Often useful but denied by default; offline databases and pinned metadata are first-class.  
**Browser execution:** Not intrinsic.  
**Production access:** No production mutation or registry publishing.

## Domain-specific threats

- poisoned package metadata
- malicious registries
- advisory tampering
- dependency confusion
- signed-but-untrusted artifacts
- SBOM incompleteness
- credential exposure

## Required safe defaults

- deny undeclared permissions and destinations;
- use direct argv and sanitized environments;
- never install or update tools automatically;
- isolate project execution and controlled resources;
- treat input, repository, tool output, browser content, telemetry, schemas, policies, and prompts as untrusted data;
- redact secrets and sensitive source/evidence in reports;
- bound time, CPU, memory, process count, output, archives, and external data;
- record actual permissions/effects in the durable result;
- prohibit downstream authority not explicitly owned by the product boundary.

## Capability-specific authority statement

The capability conclusion cannot itself authorize the action it evaluates. The project build packet must include adversarial tests that prove this boundary under pressure.
